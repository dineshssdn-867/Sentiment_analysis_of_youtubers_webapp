# Sentiment Web App
Sentiment analysis is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. So, in this application, we are asking a YouTuber to enter the channel id and a particular timeline. By using the channel id and timeline we are performing sentiment analysis on his videos by fetching the subtitles of their videos in a particular timeline given by the YouTuber.Basically performing intent and emotion classification on his video subtitles.
